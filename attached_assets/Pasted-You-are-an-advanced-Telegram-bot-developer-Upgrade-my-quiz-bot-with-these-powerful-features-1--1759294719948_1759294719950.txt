You are an advanced Telegram bot developer. Upgrade my quiz bot with these powerful features:

1. **Permanent Storage**:
   - Store all groups where bot is added (chat_id, title, type, date_added).
   - Store all users who start the bot in DM (user_id, first_name, username, date_joined).
   - Use SQLite for reliable permanent storage.
   - Remove ID automatically if bot is kicked/blocked.

2. **Broadcast System**:
   - Add command `/broadcast <message>` (admin only).
   - Works in both groups and DMs.
   - No forward tag ‚Äî always send fresh messages (sendMessage/sendQuiz/sendPhoto/etc).
   - Supports text, media, inline buttons, and quizzes.
   - Send in safe batches to avoid Telegram flood limits.
   - Preview and confirmation:
     - On `/broadcast <text>` ‚Üí bot shows preview + total recipients.
     - Inline buttons: [‚úÖ Confirm] [‚ùå Cancel].
   - After completion, bot shows admin a full report (Total / Sent / Failed / Skipped).

3. **Auto Quiz System**:
   - When a user runs `/start` in DM ‚Üí wait 5 seconds ‚Üí send first quiz automatically.
   - When bot is added to a group ‚Üí wait 5 seconds ‚Üí send first quiz automatically.
   - Always store `last_quiz_message_id` for each chat.
   - Before sending a new quiz (auto or broadcast), delete the old quiz message first.
   - Quizzes should use `sendPoll` with type `"quiz"` and multiple-choice options.

     - Total Users
     - Total Quizzes Sent
     - Quizzes Sent Today

   - If message fails, skip and continue (do not stop broadcast).
   - Handle Too Many Requests errors with retry_after.

7. **Logging**:
   - Log every broadcast (admin_id, text, total targets, sent, failed, skipped, timestamp).
   - Log quizzes sent (quiz_id, chat_id, timestamp).
   - Logs stored in DB.

8. **Extra Features**:
   - Support placeholders in broadcast: {first_name}, {username}, {chat_title}, {bot_name}.
   - Inline buttons supported in both quizzes and broadcasts.
   - Provide `/broadcast cancel` command to stop an ongoing broadcast safely.

Action: Implement this complete system in my quiz bot using Python (aiogram/pyrogram/python-telegram-bot depending on existing code). Ensure broadcast, auto quiz, quiz auto-delete, and live bot stats tracking all work perfectly in both groups and private chats.
