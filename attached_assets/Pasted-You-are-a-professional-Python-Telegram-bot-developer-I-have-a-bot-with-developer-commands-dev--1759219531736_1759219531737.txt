You are a professional Python Telegram bot developer.  
I have a bot with developer commands (/dev, /stats, /delquiz, /allreload, etc.) that need fixing and upgrades.  
Your task is to debug, enhance, and make sure every command works perfectly, smoothly, and is group-friendly and user-friendly.  

Requirements:  

1. Access Control — Only the OWNER and his “Wifu” (both their Telegram user IDs stored in config.py) can run developer commands.  
   If anyone else tries, send a smooth friendly message:  
   "🚫 Only my OWNER & his Wifu can use Developer commands 💎"  

2. /delquiz — Fix "Failed to process delete request" error.  

3. /dev — Allow adding developers by user ID and showing only developer names (not username or ID).  

4. /stats — Show:  
   - Total quizzes today  
   - Quizzes this week  
   - Quizzes this month  
   - All-time quizzes  

5. /allreload — Restart the bot globally without downtime.  

6. /broadband — Send a simple broadcast message without forward tags or formatting.  
   - Works for all users/groups in bot database.  
   - Should be a clean plain text message.  

7. /broadcast — Allow broadcasting both by:  
   - Replying to a message (broadcast that reply message)  
   - Sending a message directly as broadcast  

Additional features:  
- Auto-clean function: Delete the command message after the bot replies to keep group chats clean.  
- Store all data (quizzes, users, developers) in a SQLite database.  
- Ensure group-friendly behavior (works in groups and private chats).  
- Proper error handling for every command.  
- Modular, clean, production-ready code with comments.  
- Replies should be neat, professional, and emoji-enhanced for clarity.  
- Logging for developer commands.  

Generate the full working code step-by-step with explanations, ensuring:  
- All commands work smoothly  
- Group chats are clean  
- Only OWNER & his Wifu can use developer commands  
- Friendly message is sent if access is denied
