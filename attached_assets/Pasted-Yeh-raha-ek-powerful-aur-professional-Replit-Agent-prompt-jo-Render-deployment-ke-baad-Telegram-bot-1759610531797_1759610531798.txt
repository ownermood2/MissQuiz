ðŸ’¥ Prompt for Replit Agent (Copyâ€“Paste As-Is)

You are an expert Python developer and deployment engineer.  
Your task is to fix, optimize, and professionally structure a Telegram bot project that fails to run correctly after deployment on Render.  

ðŸ§© Issues:
- /start, /help, and /mystats commands are not working after deployment.
- Developer-only commands are not accessible.
- Stats are not updating or being saved properly.
- Logs on Render show runtime or webhook-related errors.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
1. Automatically detect and fix all issues related to:
   - Telegram Bot API setup (use python-telegram-bot or telebot depending on current project).
   - Webhook and polling compatibility for Render, Replit, and VPS.
   - Flask or FastAPI server configuration for Render.
   - Command handlers not registering or responding.
   - Missing async/await or event loop errors.
   - Database or file handling for /mystats updates.

2. Make the bot auto-detect its environment:
   - If running locally â†’ use polling mode.
   - If on Render or Replit â†’ auto-run Gunicorn with Flask/FastAPI webhook.

3. Ensure all commands work smoothly:
   - /start shows welcome message.
   - /help lists all user and developer commands properly.
   - /mystats updates and fetches data in real-time.
   - Developer commands accessible only to admin IDs.

4. Clean and optimize project structure:
   ðŸ“¦ telegram-bot/
   â”£ ðŸ“œ main.py
   â”£ ðŸ“œ requirements.txt
   â”£ ðŸ“œ Procfile
   â”£ ðŸ“œ .replit
   â”£ ðŸ“œ config.py
   â”£ ðŸ“œ README.md
   â”— ðŸ“‚ modules/ (for commands and handlers)

5. Remove duplicate, junk, or unused files.  
6. Ensure requirements.txt includes all dependencies used.  
7. Add comments for clarity and maintainability.  
8. Verify deployment runs error-free on Render using:
   `bash
   gunicorn main:app

and local mode via:

python main.py

ðŸ§  Finally:

Debug and automatically repair any logic, import, or async issues.

Recheck that the bot responds correctly on Telegram after /start and /help.

Validate webhook URL and update it automatically during deployment.


Make sure the final output code is clean, professional, and production-ready for Render + Replit + VPS.
