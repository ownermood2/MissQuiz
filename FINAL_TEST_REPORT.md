# Final Test Report - Telegram Quiz Bot

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0 (Enhanced)

## ✅ Task 1: Restart Confirmation Message - COMPLETED

### Implementation Details:
1. **Flag File System**: 
   - Created `data/.restart_flag` file when `/allreload` is executed
   - File contains timestamp of restart request
   - Flag is checked on bot initialization in `main.py`

2. **Confirmation Flow**:
   - When `/allreload` is executed:
     - Shows "🔄 Restarting bot now..." message
     - Creates flag file with timestamp
     - Restarts the bot
   - On bot startup:
     - Checks for flag file existence
     - If exists: Sends confirmation to OWNER_ID
     - Removes flag file after sending (prevents duplicate messages)
     - If not exists: Normal startup (no message)

3. **Confirmation Message**:
```
✅ Bot restarted successfully and is now online!

🕒 Timestamp: 2025-09-30 HH:MM:SS
⚡ All systems operational
```

### Testing Instructions:
To test the restart confirmation:
1. Run `/allreload` command as OWNER or developer
2. Bot will show: "🔄 Restarting bot now..."
3. Wait 3-5 seconds for bot to restart
4. OWNER will receive confirmation message in PM
5. Only OWNER receives this message (not all developers)
